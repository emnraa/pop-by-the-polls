                <h3>Environmentalism</h3>
                <p>
                  Stein believes that we need a national comprehensive water
                  plan, believing that "clean water is a human right."

                <p>
                  Stein has advocated for the abolition of abolishing the large
                  amount of college debt that plagues many young people coming
                  right out of university.

                <p>
                  There is a refugee crisis that Stein believes is created
                  mainly by US military interventions and Stein believes we need
                  to take responsibility by taking in refugees.

                <p>
                  Steing stands for a Medicare-for-all system largely due to the
                  fact that healthcare costs are spent on wasteful practices.

                <h3>Jill Stein</h3>
                <p>
                  Jill Stein was also the Green Party Presidential candidate in
                  2012 and has taken part in the victories of campaign finance
                  reform, racially-just redistricting, green jobs, and the
                  cleanup of incinerators, coal plants, and toxic threats. She
                  was also a main organizer for the Global Climate Convergence
                  for People, Planet and Peace over Profit. She has many stances
                  relating to environmentalism and a cleaner planet due to her
                  exposure and vast knowledge on the links between toxic
                  exposures and illnesses that she became aware of in 1990.
